Howdy! My name is Kelsey Wickerham. I am a full time student at Arizona State University pursuing my Master's in Program Evaluation and Data Analytics. If you haven't caught on by now, I am also a Swiftie.

My days are filled with my graduate coursework, wrangling the two kittens I foster failed on, and re-watching Sex and the City. While I am too landlocked in San Antonio, TX to enjoy long walks on the beach, I do enjoy strolls on the Riverwalk (and making pitstops for margaritas).

Two truths and a lie about me:

1. I am a guitarist.
2. I have performed in Carnegie Hall.
3. I have travelled to 10 different countries.

### My story

When I started my undergraduate degree, I was going to school to become a choir director. Music was (and still is) a cornerstone of my life, which was what drove me to pursue a degree in music education.

Early on in my journey, I began to question if music education was the right major for me. I had always been interested in public policy, specifically as it related to education. I changed my major a couple of times my sophomore year, but ultimately settled on still pursuing the music education degree and getting a minor in political science, with the goal of working in education policy on some level.

During the fall semester of my junior year of college, I began to experience troubling health issues. Almost overnight, I began to have issues walking down flights of stairs and rising from seated positions. Walking became a challenge due to discomfort in my legs and balance issues. I made the difficult decision to leave my program and pursue an online degree, that way I could live with family  out-of-state and seek answers for what I was experiencing. My options were limited, but I ended up settling on majoring in sociology (I actually did end up completing a degree in music, though there was no specialization in education or performance).

While I enjoyed all of my sociology courses, my quantitative research class was the most impactful on me. I was able to utilize my knowledge of statistics I gained in AP Stats my senior year of high school and apply it to my burning questions about social policy - something I remained passionate about. Seeing the real world application of statistics and its importance for conceptualizing data in a way that could impact lives was exciting. All of my life I knew I wanted to make a difference in the world, and it seemed to me that I was being taught how I could do so on a larger scale.

Upon  graduating college, I had the opportunity to move to California where I started working as a case manager for a non-profit that provided Permanent Supportive Housing to chronically homeless individuals and families. I loved the work I was doing and knew I was helping my clients, but I never felt fully satisfied in my job. I was constantly reading studies on how to improve the services we provided to make them more effective, longing to be the person conducting the research instead.

When COVID hit, I began to work semi-remotely. I also saw a progression of my neurological disorder (what was eventually diagnosed as hereditary spastic paraplegia). Working from home part time improved my quality of life drastically and made me realize I needed a full time position. When I had the opportunity to work full time on a project providing rental assistance to Californians impacted by the pandemic, I jumped on it. While I started as an "eligibility analyst" who simply reviewed applications and conducted outreach for supporting documents as needed, I quickly rose in rank to a managerial position. There, I showed a penchant for data analytics and reporting, which led me to doing that for the project full time.

It was **thrilling** for me to have my passions realized. Using data, I was able to guide project management's decisions to improve efficiency in our processes, prioritize applicants wih the most need, and so much more. While I came into the role with a background in statistics, though, I knew I could do more - so I enrolled in my graduate program with ASU.

In July 2024, about a  year into the project close out, I was laid off from my firm. While I am currently unemployed, I am seeking data analyst opportunities in a variety of industries. My passion still lies in public service, though I have a growing interest in sports analytics courtesy of the Los Angeles Chargers and fantasy football. I am staying busy with school and additional courses in Data Camp, and am hoping to graduate in December 2025.
